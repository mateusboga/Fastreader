# Fastreader

Read and learn 3 different alphabets as fast as you can! Practice your reading of Greek, Cyrillic and Hebrew characters.

**Note:** I made this in the past year as an exercise to try and find a way to teach myself how to read other alphabets that I was interested in learning, and recently came across these files and decided it was a good idea to publish them, so enjoy!
